# Data science algorithms
This repository has some of the data science algorithms implemented from scratch to understand and grasp basic concepts.

## Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Implementation of multilayer perceptron/neural network from scratch.
1. Sample data (with non-linear decision boundary) 
2. Plot decision boundary of Logistic Regression
3. Plot decision boundary of MLP with hidden layer size = 3
4. Plot variation in decision boundary with hidden layer size
This exercise shows the capability of neural network to form non-linear decision boundaries where logistic regression fails through an example. Also, shows the variation in decision boundary as we increase the number of nodes in hidden layer.
