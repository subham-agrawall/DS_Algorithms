# Data science algorithms
This repository has some of the data science algorithms implemented from scratch to understand and grasp basic concepts.

## Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Implementation of multilayer perceptron/neural network from scratch
1. Sample data points
2. Plot decision boundary of Logistic Regression
3. Plot decision boundary of MLP with hidden layer size = 3
4. Plot variation in decision boundary with hidden layer size
