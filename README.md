# Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

Implementation of multilayer perceptron/neural network from scratch to understand and grasp basic concepts of Deep Learning. 

Outputs/Plots:
1. Generated dataset for classification 
2. Decision boundary from Logistic Regression model
3. Decision boundary from MLP with hidden layer size = 3
4. Variation in decision boundary with hidden layer size

This exercise shows the capability of neural network to form non-linear decision boundaries where logistic regression fails through an example. Also, shows the variation in decision boundary as we increase the number of nodes in hidden layer.
